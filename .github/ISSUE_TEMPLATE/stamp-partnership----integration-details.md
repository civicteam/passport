Instructions:
Hello! Thank you for taking the time to propose a Stamp for the Passport app.

We're excited to work with you on reviewing your Stamp. Please fill out the following information. Failure to do so will result in delays reviewing your Stamp or we may reject your proposal entirely.

You'll find a series of questions and fields below containing information we need from you to properly review your Stamp. Any text surrounded by angle brackets (<>) should be replaced with the appropriate information about your project. Headings should be followed by a few sentences that answer the question or explain the topic.

When you finish, please fill out this Google form if you have any information that you'd like to pass along that must be private: https://forms.gle/tr1CWZgE4fWGQxam8

## Metadata

Project Name: <project name>
Stamp name: <stamp name>
Website: <https://www.project.com>

## Data and Credentials

<!--
Each Stamp can have one or more verifiable credential (VC) that can be verified by users. For example, our Snapshot Stamp has two different VCs: "Voted on two or more DAO proposals" and "Created a DAO proposal that was voted on by at least one account" 

For each verifiable credential you issue as part of your Stamp, please provide:
- the VC name (i.e. `SnapshotVotesProvider`)
- the data point in your app that supports this VC (i.e. User must have voted on 2 or more DAO proposals)
- difficulty to achieve (based on % of your users who qualify): <easy|medium|hard>
-->

## Reasoning

<!--
We're looking for data (and ultimately VCs) that can help us detect and prevent bots. Please share a few sentences here that outline how the data provided by your Stamp will help us do that.
